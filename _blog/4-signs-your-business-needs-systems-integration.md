Nowadays, digitalisation is an inevitable step for a business if it wants to remain competitive. More and more companies are using online platforms and software solutions to boost their productivity and thus improve their service. Also, it is a great way to reach more customers. However, buying a tool is insufficient – you must know how to use it.

Some organisations do not find it necessary to acquire an entire system immediately and prefer to use independent tools instead. It may be a good idea to start your business journey with this. However, it is essential to remember that the more tools you use, the less effective they become. They may work well separately, but they will not function as an integrated whole without actually being integrated. Consequently, you may be wasting your money and time on tools that do not yield the expected results. Luckily, it is easy to recognise when your business should integrate its systems.


## What is systems integration?
It is impossible for independent tools; usually all coming from different vendors, to cooperate to simplify your work and provide you with accurate data. One way to deal with this problem is to buy a completely new complex system, which will, unfortunately, result in losing valuable information and time spent getting to know the new solution. Luckily, system integrators – companies or teams of specialists experienced in the area – are there to help you. They can put all of your components together into one, ensuring seamless data connectivity and task automation.

The process which enables your company to grow and evolve is highly beneficial. I have described the most significant advantages of systems integration if you would like to know them here.


### Signs your business needs systems integration
Many organisations do not recognise the damage that a lack of systems integration can cause and thus find it impossible to develop the right solution. However, the effects of using various components instead of one system are usually the same for each company, no matter their industry. It would be best if you considered having your systems integrated as soon as you notice these changes:

#### 1. Drop in employee productivity – 
when your company evolves, you expect your employees to be as productive as possible to keep up with the growth. Without introducing systems integration, you are the one who slows your team down. Instead of handling their core duties, your employees are stuck submitting data manually to several systems which do not cooperate. As the task is highly labour-intensive, there is a proneness towards errors and a drop in their productivity at the same time. Spending hours on one tedious task may stop them from facing upcoming challenges.
With systems integration, data flows between your systems, ensuring high data consistency. Your employees can focus on more challenging and essential duties and follow the company's growth. Re-entering information is now automated, which minimises the risk of errors.


#### 2. A constant need for new hires – 
growing your team is an inevitable step for every business. New employees introduce new ideas and new challenges to your company. However, their number may sometimes go beyond your possibilities, especially if your systems are not integrated, and your employees find it hard to handle all their challenging activities when spending hours re-entering data and manually analysing information from various systems. Hiring new employees to manage these processes may seem like the only solution.

With systems integration, you can automate many business processes so your employees can complete their duties. Growing your team can be a great opportunity only if your company benefits from new hires. Integrating your systems allows you to save money and keep your employees motivated as they can focus on their actual job.


#### 3. Losing customers – 
this applies to the sales industry especially, but it can also affect your business. When running an online store not integrated with your warehouse and other departments, customers may find it hard to access the data necessary to place an order. It also takes longer for your employees to address all the enquiries as they have to be entered into all the systems manually. With extended waiting time and poor customer service, you will soon notice you are losing customers.
With systems integration, you can operate your sales system more smoothly, making it easier for your customers and employees. Your clients can now access the necessary data (such as whether the product is available, when they can receive it, etc.) without phoning or e-mailing you. At the same time, your employees can address their needs more efficiently and reply to them immediately.


#### 4. Quality of sales - 
the quality of your sales depends on the data flow between your departments. For the order to be completed successfully, it takes all departments, with sales and financial departments and the warehouse especially, to keep in touch constantly. If it takes hours for the sales department to inform the warehouse about an order placement, the product may already be unavailable. The information may take even longer to reach the financial department, which means a delayed refund and a dissatisfied customer. Basing your business on outdated information and processes performed manually makes it harder for you to remain reliable.
With systems integration, there is no need to worry. The information flows between the departments constantly and automatically, which means your employees can immediately address every order. Also, it minimises the risk of order failure and improves employee communication.

## Stay passionate
Before developers even realise it, they can find themselves in a pool of chores at home, kids to take to football practice and other aspects of daily life that can interrupt the creative flow. In a developer’s day-to-day, many things change. This can make excuses incredibly easy to come upon. But the following may help any developer stay passionate about their work.

## Avoid failure triggers
The difference between what developers want and what a product development department wants is often not the same. While a developer aims to build a working app that can be maintained, the product development department may only like functional software. The result is a substandard app that the developer can have no pride in creating.

To avoid this, a developer must convince the department that doing things the right way is far more favourable – and has a much higher degree of profitability – than designing an unstable app in a short time.

Another failure trigger is poor project management, which can far overshadow all of the efforts a developer may have put into an app. Additionally, so is having no choice but to use cheaply-made hardware and software to create an app, as well as working with a partner who is content not to deliver. Changing scope and un-discussed expectations are two more very common failure triggers.

## How can management contribute to developers’ happiness?
Management can ensure the happiness of their developers by taking several simple steps.

**1. More people are using mobile than ever.**
Over 5 billion people are now using mobile apps, leaving a plethora of opportunities for developers to create apps that will be seen, used and valued.

**2. Have a clear vision**
Management’s vision should read like a road map for developers. That means every turn is explained, and every twist is clarified.

**3. Don’t assume**
Assuming that a developer has the tools they need to develop an app without confirming is a sure recipe for failure. Giving them training and support can remedy this.

**4. Be fair**
Being fair to developers, respecting them, and creating trust are crucial. A supportive environment is a healthy one. Trust begets trust, which can lead to higher morale and inspiration to be a valuable contribution to the team. Management can also help developers by taking steps to ensure that their work is highly valued. This can be done via recognition, praise and performance incentives. Developers who are happy where they are far less likely to leave a company.

## How can developers contribute to their happiness?
If things aren’t as rosy as they used to be, considering these few facts can keep a developer motivated and happy.

**1. More people are using mobile than ever.**
Over 5 billion people are now using mobile apps, leaving a plethora of opportunities for developers to create apps that will be seen, used and valued.

**2. Revenues will rise**
Revenues from mobile app stores are projected to get pretty serious – $45.4 billion worth in 2015 alone. By 2017, it’s expected that these revenues will be at $76.2 billion or more.

**3. Work will always be available**
Because mobile is growing faster than all other forms of digital advertising, at least in the United States, developers can expect to have plenty of work over the next few years.

**4. Choose to do your part**
Creating apps that help to improve some aspect of the world can make a developer’s work far more rewarding.

**5. Realise that you have a voice**
Developers are often on the front lines and are the first to know when there is a problem. Although it may be difficult, effectively communicating the gravity of the situation to management is critical. Bolster your confidence by remembering that you have a voice. Taking the above into consideration can result in a much more satisfying experience for developers and management alike.

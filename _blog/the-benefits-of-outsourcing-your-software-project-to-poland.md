## 2020 Developers Survey does not lie
The Polish technology industry has undergone a significant transformation over the past decade. Poland is now home to one of the world's most advanced software development communities, with an increasing number of companies realising the benefits of outsourcing their software projects to Poland due mainly to the high quality and low cost. The 2020 Developer Survey, which Stack Overflow conducted, further reinforces how Polish developers have risen through global ranks in the past few years.

## Why are Polish developers so experienced?
In fact, developers in Poland have an average of 11.5 years of experience coding, ranking 8th in the world and 5th in Europe. This means that when working with Polish developers, you are more likely to deal with trusted professionals who have long-term experience and understand the marketplace.

Additionally, on average, developers in Poland start learning how to code before the age of 15, ranking 2nd in the world for the youngest average age. What is even more impressive is that 8.9% of Polish developers started coding before the age of 10. When looking at the average age by country, respondents from countries such as Brazil and India tend to start writing code two years later compared to developers in countries such as Poland. This further reinforces why the technological sphere in Poland is so advanced. With developers starting to code at such a young age, they can become far more proficient early on. This is why, when outsourcing your software projects to Poland, you will be working with experts who can understand your vision and execute it at the highest quality using the most current and advanced technology â€“ all at a lower cost than hiring full-time developers for your company.

## Other benefits to the Polish software industry
Whilst there is still a lot to be done across the globe regarding gender equality in both the software development industry and the technology as a whole, Poland is ahead of the curve, ranking 10th for gender representation in the world and 5th in Europe. An equal workplace is a better workplace, with many studies arguing that gender diversity leads to more innovative thinking and a more productive workplace.

Additionally, Poland ranks 11th out of 100 countries for English proficiency. This high level of proficiency allows for accessible communication between employees at your company and the developers that have been outsourced.

Poland leads the way as one of the top countries to outsource your software project due not only to the expertise and trustworthiness of many of the developers that work there but also to the balance between high-quality work and competitive prices. Furthermore, easy and efficient communication means your company's vision can be realised and executed perfectly.

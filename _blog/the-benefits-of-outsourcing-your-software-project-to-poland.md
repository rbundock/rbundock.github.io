## 2020 Developers Survey does not lie
The Polish technology industry has gone through a significant transformation over the past decade. Poland is now home to one of the most advanced software development communities in the world, with an increasing number of companies realising the benefits of outsourcing their software projects to Poland due largely to the high quality and low cost. The 2020 Developer Survey which was conducted by Stack Overflow further reinforces how Polish developers have risen through global ranks in the past few years.

## Why are Polish developers so experienced?
In fact, developers in Poland have an average of 11.5 years’ experience coding, ranking 8th in the world and 5th in Europe. This means that when working with Polish developers you are more likely to be dealing with trusted professionals who have long-term experience and understand the marketplace.

Additionally, on average developers in Poland start learning how to code before the age of 15, ranking 2nd in the world for the youngest average age. What is even more impressive is that 8.9% of Polish developers started coding before the age of 10. When looking at the average age by country, respondents from countries such as Brazil and India tend to start writing code a full two years later compared to developers in countries such as Poland. This further reinforces why the technological sphere in Poland is so advanced. With developers starting to code at such a young age, they are able to become far more proficient early on. Which is why, when outsourcing your software projects to Poland, you will be working experts who are able not only to understand your vision but execute it at the highest quality using the most current and advanced technology – all at a lower cost than hiring full-time developers for your company.

## Other benefits to the Polish software industry
Whilst there is still a lot to be done across the globe in regards to gender equality in both the software development industry and the technology as a whole, Poland is ahead of the curve, ranking 10th for gender representation in the world and 5th in Europe. An equal workplace is a better workplace, with many studies arguing that gender diversity leads to more innovative thinking and a more productive workplace.

Additionally, Poland ranks 11th out of 100 countries for English proficiency. This high level of proficiency allows for easy communication between employees at your company and the developers that have been outsourced.

Poland leads the way as one of the top countries to outsource your software project to due not only to the expertise and trustworthiness of many of the developers that work there, but also thanks to the balance between high-quality work and competitive prices. Furthermore, easy and efficient communication means that your company vision can be realised and executed perfectly.

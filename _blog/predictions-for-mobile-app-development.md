title:  "Predictions for mobile app development"
---
The fierce competition in the mobile space continues, and, as a result, developers continue to look for the next big thing. Indeed, all it takes is to leverage an emerging trend, and an app can quickly rise to superstardom. With the mobile development industry continuing its evolution, there’s no better time than now to share our predictions for the industry this year.

## Enterprise apps will grow in number and popularity
This year has already seen many opportunities for app developers to focus on the building and managing of applications for the enterprise market, and this growth is expected to continue.

## Multi-purpose design will become a requirement
Although wearable technology is being offered by more companies than ever before and is becoming ever popular with consumers, this technology is moving beyond the body to enter televisions, cars and homes. As such, app developers will anticipate that customers will need to be able to use these apps from within this connected landscape, and not just from a single device.

## Anticipatory moments will take centre stage
The current techniques being used engage users are shifting to what has been named the ‘micro moment’. Micro moments, defined as brief interactions designed to get customer attention with the purpose of anticipating their needs, will continue this year. As a result of the shift, developer thinking will need to shift as well. This trend is expected to cause the end of traditional singular applications. Developers will instead likely use several capabilities such as notices in order to connect with users several times a day.

## Additional security will be needed
This year will see a large percentage of apps not being able to pass even the most basic of security tests. It is also expected that errors in mobile app configurations will cause security breaches into 2017 and beyond. Unfortunately, this will likely lead to sensitive data being put at risk, as more business users continue to use their smartphones and tablets for work purposes.

## Apps will become cloud-based
Because apps will require integration of various devices in order to be used to their full potential, this will see them being placed in the cloud instead of on individual devices like they are today. This will allow users to move more easily between devices as needed for work or at home. Each app will perform as well on one device as it does another, offering the opportunity for full functionality whether the user is on a computer or hand-held device.

## Websites will imitate apps
With apps set to be usable across several devices, they will also cross into the web site realm. That being said, more websites will start performing like apps. This means the addition of characteristics like responsive design, automatic updating and two-way communication. It is expected that the gap between the way websites display information and the way that apps do will continue its decrease this year.

## The app store will be king
As businesses continue to adopt the use of app stores, the stores themselves will increase their utility beyond the provision of company apps to employees. Instead, it will be discovered that app stores can be a solution for consolidating systems that are currently managed separately. App stores may also end up being used to manage software licenses via the combination of application requests and existing software licensing processes.

The Internet of Things, (or IoT) will see the creation of more mobile experiences than ever before. Smart homes, cities and offices will soon be connected and managed using nothing more than a single smartphone.

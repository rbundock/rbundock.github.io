## Tips and tricks
When thinking about developing a mobile application for your business, the first thing that comes to mind may be management software to help with scheduling tasks or a business calendar, allowing you to keep track of progress. But mobile applications are so much more. They can be used in many ways to communicate with your customers or attract the attention of new ones. There are so many more ideas waiting to be reformed into working applications.

## Property Magnate
One example of a mobile application created for a business that involves the community and customers to get their attention and interest is Property Magnate.

Property Magnate is a mobile game developed by Headchannel Ltd. for a client from the UK. The Client wanted to create a game where people could feel like they were investing their money into properties, earn money and finally become a property magnate. The game is particularly enticing because it uses real data from Zoopla.co.uk, which means over 18 000 000 properties that can be bought from and sold to both other players and in-game acquisition agents. The game does its job and attracts people to the property industry and generates its profit.

## Visibility
To gain users for your mobile app, you should pay attention to visibility. Optimising a mobile app begins right from the moment the developer starts working on it and continues throughout the entire cycle and that is why you should choose the right company to develop your idea and create the app for you. But as mentioned, you can work on visibility through the whole of its lifetime.

There are at least 4 ways you can do this.

 **1. Use the right keywords**
First of all, when a user searches for an app, keywords help to promote your app to appear higher within the app category and overall listing. This will increase both app views and installs. Start by researching competitive apps and create your list of keywords. Firstly, focus on low competition keywords, as this is an easy way to rank highly on the list. Then, after receiving a good number of reviews and downloads, you can optimise further to find more competitive keywords. In the Apple App Store, there is a special place where you can enter keywords, limited to 100 characters, while Google Play Store gets relevant keywords from the app description to rank the app.

 **2. Encourage users to rate and review**
Other vital factors for app visibility are user ratings and reviews. Many app stores promote and rate apps based on positive reviews and ratings. In this case, asking your customers to rate and review might be a good idea. You can even send them to push notifications. But remember that fake reviews are easily identified by app stores and will give you nothing. It would be best if you focused on your real customers’ experience. The App Store considers positive ratings and reviews of an app as one of the key validations for an app’s quality.

 **3. Add screenshots and videos**
Screenshots are crucial because most users want to know how your app looks and also how it works. Having a few attractive screenshots can be a call to action. Use your two best images first to encourage users to swipe through your pictures and take a closer look. Make your screenshots better by cleaning them up from unnecessary bloat on the status bar but remember not to change it too much. It must show the current look of the app, not the idealised one. Good videos might also significantly increase your apps ranking in the store. But creating a professional video can be costly. Sometimes a slideshow of your screenshots can have the same beneficial effect and does not cost so much. Another alternative is to buy a mockup and once again use screenshots to make it relevant and interesting.

 **4. Name and describe**
When selecting a name for your app, go through a few catchy keywords that in your opinion, maybe searched when users are looking for the right product. It may help the ranking of your app and make it easier for customers to find. The name should be short, catchy and give users an idea of what to expect from the application at first glance. Additionally, a well-designed description, full of keywords and very substantive can be one of your most significant advantages against competitive apps. Make it interesting, add bullet points that detail the main features and benefits of using it and convince the reader that it is exactly what they need.

There are a number of reasons why you should invest in a mobile app for your business, but if you are still not convinced, read this article and find out why you need it. It is essential to use your resources as efficiently as possible, and a new app could become one of your key resources. That is why you should analyse user needs and improve the visibility of your mobile app to reach more customers and increase the overall performance.

Consortium secures Innovate UK funding to deliver a disruptive, ‘Quick Fit’ prosthetic fit solution for lower limb amputees.

HeadChannel is working with South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Quantum Technology Supersensors, FCi Viocare Clinic UK and Teesside University to deliver a disruptive, innovative ‘Quick Fit’ prosthetic socket design fitting solution for prosthetists to use for lower limb amputees.

## Challenge and solution
The conventional design and manufacturing process for a prosthetic socket requires a patient to visit a clinic multiple times over one or more weeks. What if this time could be reduced to a couple of hours using a temporary ‘Quick Fitting’ low-cost smart sensor technology combined with easy-to-use software?

There have been attempts to eliminate the socket by directly attaching the artificial limb to the residual bone through osseointegration; however, most (>60%, diabetes-related) patients with amputations will not be candidates for this procedure. Poor-fitting socket problems often emanate from the over-reliance on a skilled prosthetist to determine the load-bearing capability across the stump using a “touch and feel” technique without quantitative measurements, and the process can be very time-consuming.

There is a continuing need for a ‘quick’ and improved prosthetic socket provision solution that addresses these limitations and challenges. The innovation will transform the prosthetics market and address the patient needs much faster than currently achievable. The aim of the project is to use temporary retrofit sensors to reduce the current time taken to achieve a good fit socket from days or weeks to a couple of hours whilst also achieving a better fit.

This unique partnership will combine sensor development, biomedical engineering, software and healthcare expertise to deliver and exploit the project.

**“As a business, we are proud to be working with several commercial and research institutions at the cutting edge of the battle to deliver value to patients, and this grant is a testament to the scope of our ambition in the life sciences sector and the value of our technology”**

**Said Andrew Green, HeadChannel’s Director.**

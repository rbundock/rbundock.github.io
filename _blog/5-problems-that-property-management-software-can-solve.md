Below you will find a list of 5 examples of problems that might be solved thanks to property management software.


## 1. Not enough time
Property management is a tough process absorbing a lot of time and other resources. There are situations when it is necessary to deal with many issues at once and time is running out. If only a day had more hours. Property management software can take over part of your responsibilities, gain you some time so your team can focus on the most important issues of the business. You no longer have to be firefighting issues instead of planning ahead, creating long-term solutions and acquiring new promising properties. Your business can benefit from that because fewer resources are wasted on issues that might be automated by a property management software solution.

## 2. Increasing overheads
To create an environment suitable for your business to grow you need to invest and acquire more strategic properties and real estates but this might require you to employ more employees which might be expensive. Property management software makes work easier thus you do not have to hire new staff in order to keep expanding your business. Automation and streamlined workflow is easier and more efficient to manage. Even a small team of people who know the business, equipped with powerful software solutions can make significant changes and, with the knowledge, lead the business to better prosperity.

## 3. Difficult access and control over data
In urgent situations the most important thing is time. Do not waste it or money on looking for documents and copying data when it is needed the most. Well-designed property management software makes data more transparent and stores it in one place where it can be found and used much more time-effectively and you can go with the flow of investment. With your management and accounting systems integrated you can store all your data in one place and have full control over it.

## 4. Missing key dates
It is not easy to manage a calendar manually and stick to the dates established in the past when there are many properties to manage. When is the expiration date of the contract, when should tenants pay the rent and what are the dates for necessary maintenance work? Miss one date and many different issues may occur. Automated daily reminders are helpful because, for example, if you skip maintenance on a property you miss opportunities to fix problems before they become emergencies. Some software solutions offer you a communication platform for tenants and owners. Additionally, connecting external service providers to this system helps to manage maintenance and repairs without wasting time.

## 5. Communication breakdown
One of the most common causes of the frustration of tenants and vendors is lack of current contact with a property manager. Missing calls and emails without replies can make everybody angry. You, as a manager of the property, should be reachable at any time to provide answers and make necessary decisions but it is not easy to do so. Property management software should help you to communicate with your tenants. If they need to speak to you about, for example, a serious maintenance issue, they can do it anytime and you can provide the best service to your tenant. With property management software your communication can go smoothly and without inconvenience. Your software solution should have both an owner and tenant portal to register the need for repair or maintenance or other requests. You can also add a call center option to schedule calls with tenants or external companies to simplify all the communication processes.


There are many problems modern property managers encounter every day but nowadays, their jobs can be a lot easier and simpler. By applying a property management software solution your company can gain more market share, save time and money and increase the overall performance. You can gain something even more important â€“ loyal and happy customers that may be sure all the issues will be solved honestly and fast.

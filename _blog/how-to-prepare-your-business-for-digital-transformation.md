## Hope for the best and be prepared for the worst
The world is changing rapidly, and digital transformation affects all aspects of life, providing us with new technologies, ideas, and solutions. It is essential to keep up the pace, change typical ways of thinking and make changes within ourselves. This is all especially important for businesses. No matter if the company is big or small, present on the stock exchange or with limited liability, sooner or later these changes will be necessary. The only difference is the scale of changes and the moment in which a businessman realises that it is time to adopt new solutions and adapt to a new reality.

In the new digital era, it is increasingly common to find competitive advantages in technology. It happens by adopting new software solutions, developing digital skills and programs or by merely integrating systems to gain maximum efficiency. What’s more, digital transformation has changed not only the tools that companies work with but also the way they work and, most importantly, the customers’ expectations and demands.

Digital transformation concerns all aspects of organisations and companies including cloud, CRM, systems integration, analytics, customer experience, e-commerce, big data solutions etc. There is almost no possibility to keep up with the pace of the changes in all these aspects. Firstly you should change the way you think about your business. It would be best if you shifted from investing in old technologies to business strategies and analysis to gain knowledge about your company and its possibilities. With that knowledge, it will be easier to find out what technology upgrades your company needs the most and what the next move should be.

## Are you ready?
Is your organisation ready for digital transformation? Do not get left behind by your competition and remember to innovate your company at the right moment. At this point business analysis is very important. It can tell you where your business is in the competitive market and show you the solutions to your problems. What technologies should you innovate and transform first? Should you put more pressure on customer relations or production? An analyst can ask these and many more questions, and with that information, you will be sure when to apply your digital transformation plan and prepare your company for it.

## Choose the technologies
Not everything at once! After conducting the business analysis, you will have an idea of which technology to transform and how to do it step by step without spending vast amounts of money at once. Generally, three significant technologies can be digitised and affect your business operations.

**These are:**

**Big Data** – it transforms vast quantities of raw data into predictive and actionable insights

**The cloud** – improves the accessibility to data for the whole company and is very scalable

**IoT (Internet of Things)** – provides operational intelligence and connects all the parts of the company

These are necessary but very important parts of digital transformation. After implementing them, you can focus on more specific technologies such as business intelligence or integrating all your internal systems.

## Empower your employees
Another critical step in digital transformation is improving your employees’ knowledge. Training your employees is crucial because they will influence the overall efficiency of the company. If they do not understand the changes or perform specific tasks, the whole digital transformation might be useless. Firstly, explain to your employees what will happen in the future and why it is necessary, they need to understand the reasons for these changes. Then, organise training for them and give them time to get used to the new technology. Many external companies may help you with that. All you need to do is to find them and partner with them.

Digital Transformation will come sooner or later for your business but it is a good thing. Prepare for it and go with the flow to use it for the sake of your company. Use it to gain a competitive advantage and convince your customers that your company is the best by fulfilling their needs with style and efficiency.

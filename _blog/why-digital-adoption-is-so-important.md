The recent rise in the development of business services has drastically changed the way in which organisational infrastructures are built. Nowadays almost everything can be outsourced or treated as a service due to the high digitalisation of tasks. Companies rely less on on-premise services and instead shift to online or cloud-based solutions. Easy access to mobile devices and their ubiquity means that now employees can have access to their systems and data from any place in the world.

Aside from the fact that this digital transformation and switching to services happens everywhere, there are, of course, countless stories of companies spending huge amounts of money on brand new software solutions or platforms only to see their investment wither because they did not get what they needed. That is why it is so important to find a perfect software development partner – you can read more here. Whatever the software solution is, it can be difficult to adopt it when the organisation does not do enough to justify a new platform and encourage the employees to spend time learning how to use it. It is crucial for a new software solution to be adopted effectively.


## Problems with software adoption
There are plenty of reasons why issues could occur when it comes to software adoption. These problems usually appear in groups or through a network that is connected with other issues. Fortunately, most of them can be predicted and prevented.

Problems with software adoption
Problems with adoption may begin with a general lack of focus on what exactly the adoption and implementation should achieve in the company. You should have a clear vision of what you are hoping to achieve and share this information in order to engage others to adopt a new tool. What is very important is that employees should feel supported by management.

Another vital factor that many companies unfortunately ignore is the focus on users themselves. When implementing a pricey solution it is better to avoid any mistakes and this is one that often happens in the early stages of working on a solution. The executives’ decision may be based on the trendiness of the solution or, more likely, on the price, while the really important factors that may influence the work in the future are ignored. It is particularly important to take the user experience into consideration. They will be the ones using the solution in the future and they should be comfortable with it.

Unhappy users may want to keep using the old solution and this may affect the effectiveness of the whole system. This problem is also connected with a lack of education or training regarding the new solution. When implementing something new the employees should be trained in how to use the new tool and make the best of it. This would enable them to use the new solution in a more effective way.

In order to run the adoption smoothly, think about all the factors that may affect the implementation and think of a solution that combats the potential problems.

## Why does adoption matter so much?
Lack of digital adoption can have a drastic impact on the whole implementation and even cause significant losses in resources. Instead of simply focusing on installing new software solutions companies should focus on creating a concrete and well-considered digital adoption plan.

No matter how good or powerful the solution may be, it is as good as the number of people using it and their ability to use the system. In all these cases simply adding a new solution is not enough. Instead, making space for digital adoption means that a company is using the best possible tools and can develop faster than the competition.

As you can see software adoption may not be that easy and there are many factors that you should pay attention to. It is important to remember who you are working with and create a friendly atmosphere regarding the adoption.

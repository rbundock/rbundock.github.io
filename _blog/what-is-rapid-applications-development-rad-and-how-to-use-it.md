## What is RAD?
Are you looking for an advanced model for application development? If yes, you can consider Rapid Applications Development. It is designed for all those who want agile methods for developing applications. If you are interested to know more about this application development model, you can go through the following article. It will answer all your queries related to Rapid Applications Development (RAD).

As stated above, RAD is an application development model that focuses on quick feedback and rapid prototyping to test the features and functions of applications. By using this model, developers can create multiple iterations. As a result, they can expect a fast result. The model was developed to create the best alternative for traditional methods.

The model came into existence in the 1980s. You can say that it has been around for a long time. However, it has evolved continuously to create a better solution for users. The benefit of Rapid Applications Development is that it is not restricted, like the traditional methods. It is flexible enough to create a customized solution depending on the unique needs of users. In the beginning, it took the Spiral model shape. Over time, it changed to create the best possible solution for app development.


## 5 steps in RAD
Even if RAD has witnessed many changes during the long journey, the basic steps have remained the same. Let’s cover the five steps that you need to follow.

Step 1: define the project requirements
As it is the first step, the stakeholders need to discuss the project requirements. They can sit together to define their project requirements that include expectations, timelines, goals, and budget. Once you have a clear idea of the project, you can go ahead to get the approval of the management.

Step 2: start building prototypes
After knowing the area of projects, you can start developing prototypes. During the process, the developers, designers, and clients will work together to develop and improve the prototype. They will keep working until the final product is made.

Step 3: collect the feedback of users
We all know that the feedback of users plays an important role in the success of any project. In this phase, the beta systems and prototype will convert into working models. Developers will start gathering users’ feedback to make improvements in prototypes to get the best possible result.

Step 4: test & test & test
Now the time has come to test the software product. You need to test the software to make sure that it meets the expectations of your clients. During this phase, you will have to work on the feedback of users to test and retest the code to ensure smooth functioning.

Step 5: present the system
The final step will involve user training and conversion. After this step, the product will be launched. You need to finalize the aesthetic, interface, functions, and features of the software with your client. You need to be ensured of maintainability, usability, and stability before delivering the final product to your client.


## The main benefits of RAD
- When it comes to the benefits of the RAD, you can expect a seamless experience and the most effective product. Here are some benefits that you can consider to know RAD is worth your money and time or not.
- The enhanced adaptability enables developers to make adjustments easily while developing an application.
- The code reuse feature will leave less room for errors, and it will shorten the testing time.
- The quick iterations will ensure a fast completion and speed delivery.
- The high-level collaboration among developers, end-users, and clients will result in enhanced customer satisfaction.
- As the stakeholders can discuss all the possibilities including the code vulnerabilities, they can manage the risk fast and more effectively during the development process.
- RAD will add integrations in the early stage. Therefore, there will be only a few surprises during the entire process
- Quick reviews and customer feedback will offer a better outcome.
- Less time-consuming and better productivity

## When can you consider RAD?
RAD can be the best possible solution for application development. If you want to know when you need this application developing model, you can have a look at the following.

1. When you want to test a prototype
RAD is worth your time if you have reliable and consistent customers’ feedback on your prototype. The RAD model depends on the feedback from reliable iterations. If you have succeeded to get feedback from reliable sources, RAD can certainly help with the right solution.

2. When you have a flexible budget
It is worth mentioning that your budget will be one of the key determining factors. RAD is not expensive. However, you might need to spend on some other aspects if you consider RAD. You might need to hire skilled and experienced staff, and that is going to affect your budget. The benefit is that you can get a fast result compared to other models.

3. When you want a fast result
Rapid Applications Development can be the best for a tight deadline. When you have a fixed deadline, and you are under pressure to complete the project fast, you must use the RAD platform. It is known for offering quick solutions. Some follow a strict deadline. They do not get enough time to plan and design the project. You can use RAD to take care of all these needs. The software developing model will follow an on-the-fly approach. As a result, you can complete the project within the deadline without any exception.

RAD can enable users to develop an application fast. There will be less room for errors. You can certainly go with this if you are following a strict deadline. However, make sure that you have an experienced team to work with this model effectively. You will need a team of developers, designers, and coders. In addition to an experienced team, you will need the right technology and tools to speed up the process.

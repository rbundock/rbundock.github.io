A prototyping tool comes in handy when you want to achieve exceptional UX or if you want to work on designing your own website. It is an excellent tool to use to show potential [web developers](https://headchannel.co.uk/mobile-app-development) what you want your website to look like. There are four very easy to use prototyping tools: Moqups, Quirktools, Wireframe, and Invision App. Each of these has the potential to change the way you work with your web designers and graphic teams. These tools should reduce your cost and make the workload easier and faster for your teams.

Wireframing works off what the website will be able to do, not how it will appear with colours, images, and details. It is a skeleton. Moqups, Quirktools, and Wireframe work in this barebones realm of design prototypes. Invision is different because it allows you to see things in colour in addition to how they will work when they are live on the web for users to access.

## Moqups
Moqups is a useful tool which can help you build a template that will enable your design team to better understand your ideas. You can create the wireframes for them, enabling them to transfer the ideas to the live site and add their marketing and graphic design touches. Moqups gives you the creative outlet to put your favourite tools and features on a demo website, so that your design team can have all of your ideas in one place. Moqups leaves the graphic and design work to the professionals, but provides you with a sample to show.  The tool is easy to use, however the results seem professional.

## Quirktools
Quirktools is a tool that you can use within the web browser. It allows you and your trusted board of advisors to illustrate and collaborate with one another while creating the basic design for your website. It gives you a place to put all of your ideas together and build a blueprint for the graphic design team to use as a template.

## Wireframe
Wireframe is an interface that starts with the bare minimum. It allows you to insert your own elements, add your own splashes of colour, and provides a layout that you can share with your graphic design team. The graphic designers will be able to work off your wireframe to create the website that will go live on the web.

## Invisionapp
Invision App is one of our favourite tools because it can be integrated easily with Adobe Photoshop, Fireworks, and illustrator. Invision allows you to upload images, hook up to hotspots, and create interactions such as a live usable app. Invision is one of the premier tools because you can upload your images onto the app so that you can see how they will appear on the web or the mobile web. 

Using these tools is much better than sketching on paper or a whiteboard to share ideas. They also replace the printable templates that have been used in the past. Moqups, Quirktools, and Wireframe provide a way to put your ideas in a usable format and organise them according to how they will fit in the skeleton of the website. 

The Invision App is by far the easiest and most efficient way of getting your point across to the design team because they will be able to see the colours that you like and the image style that you would prefer to see on your website.

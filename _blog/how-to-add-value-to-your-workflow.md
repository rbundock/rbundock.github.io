## Enriching power of differences
Businesses are different. This old truth leads to the conclusion that each company is having its unique requirements when it comes to the workflow process. It means that often a business needs to find a cost-effective solution that can adapt to the individual needs of in house business practices, effectively aid in the implementation of various projects, and create a positive and efficient UX experience for both employees and customers.

## Standard practice
Generally, most companies will opt for inexpensive and generalised enterprise software to meet these needs. The problem is, however, that often the unique business practices that are required by various companies are not well catered for by mass-developed software. Custom software, on the other hand, can often add a significant element of streamlining to a workflow process, as it can be designed from the ground up with any particular business in mind. Spreadsheets are a great example of how workflow can be disrupted as a result of using pre-packed software. Often, only one employee will be able to access and modify a spreadsheet at a given time, which can quickly lead to backlogs building up, and lots of wasted time.

Additionally, most enterprise software is comprehensive in its capabilities. While this does make it accessible, it is often unable to deal with the more subtle or specialised practices a business needs, and this can lead to the whole company having to change best practices to suit a cumbersome software.

## Custom software
With workflow processes so closely linked with revenue generation and productivity, any business must make sure that they have the most optimal system in place. It is where custom software comes in. Rather than having to design business around software options that may or may not be able to handle the required tasks in the most efficient manner, custom software can be built from the ground up to do precisely what a business needs it to do. For example, this could be incorporating online forms for customers on a website that then link directly with databases of customer details, automated document creation, and so on. There is also the added benefit of more advanced security that results from using custom software.

Enterprise solutions are often bulky and loopholes, once discovered, are readily available for any would-be hacker to exploit thanks to the popularity of the products in general. Bespoke software is much harder to crack and requires much more of a dedicated effort, reducing the chances of your company being targeted in the first place.

When it comes to projects, custom software can significantly smooth over the process, helping to manage data, as well as deal with time management and tracking in a way that is natural to an individual business. It means staff can maximise their productivity and get on with the tasks at hand, rather than waiting for a spreadsheet to become available. Overall, custom software is becoming an increasingly popular choice as a result.

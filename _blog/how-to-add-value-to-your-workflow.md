## Enriching power of differences
Businesses are different. This old truth leads to the conclusion that each company has its unique requirements when it comes to the workflow process. It means that a business often needs to find a cost-effective solution that can adapt to the individual needs of in-house business practices, effectively aid in implementing various projects, and create a positive and efficient UX experience for employees and customers.

## Standard practice
Generally, most companies will opt for inexpensive and generalised enterprise software to meet these needs. However, the problem is that the unique business practices that various companies require are often not well-catered for by mass-developed software. On the other hand, custom software can often add a significant element of streamlining to a workflow process, as it can be designed from the ground up with any particular business in mind. Spreadsheets are a great example of how workflow can be disrupted due to using pre-packed software. Often, only one employee can access and modify a spreadsheet quickly, leading to backlog building up and lots of wasted time.

Additionally, most enterprise software is comprehensive in its capabilities. While this does make it accessible, it is often unable to deal with the more subtle or specialised practices a business needs, and this can lead to the whole company having to change best practices to suit cumbersome software.

## Custom software
With workflow processes so closely linked with revenue generation and productivity, any business must make sure that they have the most optimal system in place. It is where custom software comes in. Rather than having to design a business around software options that may or may not be able to handle the required tasks in the most efficient manner, custom software can be built from the ground up to do precisely what a business needs it to do. For example, this could be incorporating online forms for customers on a website that link directly with customer details databases, automated document creation, and so on. There is also the added benefit of more advanced security that results from using custom software.

Enterprise solutions are often bulky, and once discovered, loopholes are readily available for any would-be hacker to exploit, thanks to the popularity of the products in general. Bespoke software is much harder to crack and requires much more dedicated effort, reducing the chances of your company being targeted in the first place.

When it comes to projects, custom software can significantly smooth the process, helping to manage data and deal with time management and tracking in a way that is natural to an individual business. It means staff can maximise their productivity and get on with the tasks rather than waiting for a spreadsheet to become available. Overall, custom software is becoming an increasingly popular choice as a result.

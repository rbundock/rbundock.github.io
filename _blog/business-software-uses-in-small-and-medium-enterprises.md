Business software refers to any type of software specific to business users to perform certain business functions. Business software allows companies to increase the productivity of employees, reduce operational costs and measure productivity.

There are different types of business software. Some allow for interactivity via a graphical user interface, allowing users to modify, query and input data, as well as peruse results. Others are set up by the system to run at a particular time so that the initiation and monitoring of the program by employees is not required.

Whether built in-house or purchased from a vendor, business software can be virtually any size and can handle many different types of information.
 
## SaaS
SaaS, or Software as a Service, allows you to deliver applications online as opposed to installing and maintaining software on the server. Also known as web-based software, all that is needed is to access it online.

Perhaps the most significant benefit of SaaS is that, because it is run on a provider’s server, all of the maintenance and other issues that may arise are the provider’s responsibility to handle. This frees the business owner from having to hire and pay for their in-house IT department, as would be the case with software that was installed on-site.

SaaS solutions do not require a one-off large purchase; instead, the user pays a monthly fee.
 

## Cloud computing
The simplest way to describe cloud computing is to say that it is similar to SaaS, allowing access to software via the Internet. However, this option is most commonly offered on a pay-per-use basis, making it an exceedingly cost-efficient option. Cloud computing provides on-demand network access to a shared pool of resources, including storage, networks, servers and applications, as well as services.

There are several different kinds of cloud computing options in use by businesses. These include:

- **Private Cloud** – where the cloud computing service is built within a business’s walls. This option is managed by an internal IT department and is ideal for companies wanting greater control over the cloud.

- **Public Cloud** – where the cloud platform is built on an external platform and run by a provider who offers security, maintenance and system resources in exchange for a fee. Businesses looking for a greater degree of cost-effectiveness and elasticity, as well as access to the latest technology, may find the public cloud their ideal solution.

- **Hybrid Cloud** – The hybrid cloud uses both private and public clouds to provide its services to businesses.

Part of the cloud may be managed in-house by an IT department, while a provider manages the rest. Companies wanting to manage more private information themselves while storing other, non-sensitive data elsewhere may find the hybrid cloud model to be valid.
 

## Payroll/accounting software
Software to manage payroll and accounting departments is crucial to every business. Whether large or small, any business can benefit from payroll and accounting software. However, before any brand of software is chosen, the business must first evaluate its needs.

#### Any of the following are signs that accounting software could help your business:
- The business is growing, or you plan to expand it
- You’ve just started your business
- Your operations need streamlining
- You want to comply with regulations
- You want on-demand access to information
  
Any business that does not want to do their accounting themselves but needs an efficient way to manage finances will find that implementing software is the way to go.
 

## HR software
HR software allows for the storage of employee information in a single location. It can also allow for the easy tracking of employee history and quick retrieval of employee information.

#### It can also help with the organisation of the following:
- Benefits
- Wages
- Time off
- Incidents
- Documents
  
In addition to the ability to organise virtually all manner of employee information, HR software also allows for the increased security of personnel files, as access levels can be set and restrictions can be set on the information accessed.
 

## Software vs. the professional 
These days, the traditional process of hiring professionals has been replaced with finding the right business software for the tasks at hand. Regardless of the software that is ultimately chosen, one fact is inevitable. With the growing amount of data being handled by today’s businesses, the need is more significant than ever for effective software solutions that allow businesses not only to obtain but also aggregate and process the information that pertains to their company.

Regardless of the business software chosen, research is an important step. Reviewing the different features of software can provide business owners with the information they need to make an informed decision.

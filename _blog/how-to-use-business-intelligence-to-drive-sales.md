## Increase retention rate and drive up revenue
Modern technologies have transformed the way we acquire information, it is no longer a matter of using educated guesswork or relying on client feedback in order to understand your market. Business intelligence (BI) plays a crucial part in understanding both the market and your customers in order to offer compelling prices and build effective marketing campaigns. Furthermore, it allows you to suitably address the needs of your customers and win business.

## What is Business Intelligence (BI)
Business intelligence remains one of the hottest technology trends of this decade. It is a simple, yet powerful solution for companies tired of making poor business decisions and failing to spot new business opportunities. Business intelligence is a set of tools which gather and process data to present it in a graphic form for you to quickly understand. Visualising data is a great way to make use of large volumes of information which your business produces on a day to day basis.

## How to use BI to drive sales
Your business generates a lot of data every hour and you can turn this raw data into valuable information. BI tools can process and analyse data, that would otherwise be overwhelming and time-consuming, in order to influence future business decisions. By investing in BI software solutions you can turn the overload of information into new opportunities for your business, bringing data together from different departments and using this to increase revenue.

## Get quick access to real-time data
Dashboards and visualisations help to extract crucial information from the raw data and present it in clear charts and metrics. For instance, you can enter two different indicators and see how they influence each other. This automation and ease of use provides your employees with a greater amount of time, allowing them to focus on analysis.

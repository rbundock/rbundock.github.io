## Increase retention rate and drive up revenue
Modern technologies have transformed how we acquire information; it is no longer a matter of using educated guesswork or relying on client feedback to understand your market. Business intelligence (BI) plays a crucial part in understanding the market and your customers to offer compelling prices and build effective marketing campaigns. Furthermore, it allows you to suitably address your customers' needs and win business.

## What is Business Intelligence (BI)
Business intelligence remains one of the hottest technology trends of this decade. It is a simple yet powerful solution for companies tired of making poor business decisions and failing to spot new business opportunities. Business intelligence is a set of tools which gather and process data to present it in a graphic form for you to quickly understand. Visualising data is a great way to make use of large volumes of information which your business produces on a day-to-day basis.

## How to use BI to drive sales
Your business generates a lot of data every hour, and you can turn this raw data into valuable information. BI tools can process and analyse data that would otherwise be overwhelming and time-consuming in order to influence future business decisions. By investing in BI software solutions, you can turn the information overload into new opportunities for your business, bringing data together from different departments and using this to increase revenue.

## Get quick access to real-time data
Dashboards and visualisations help to extract crucial information from the raw data and present it in clear charts and metrics. For instance, you can enter two different indicators and see how they influence each other. This automation and ease of use gives your employees a greater amount of time, allowing them to focus on analysis.

## Cross-sell
It is much more cost-effective to retain an existing customer as opposed to gaining a new one. Additionally, the probability of selling to an existing customer is much higher than to a new customer. Using business intelligence software solutions, you can understand your customers, their buying habits, what they are buying and what they are not.

## Improve customer service
With more advanced knowledge of your customers, you can better identify your business needs and provide your customers with better services accompanying the main product. With the information from business intelligence tools, your sales team can better prepare a way to approach clients, discuss potential opportunities and introduce new products more effectively. By improving your customer service, you can strengthen relationships and earn loyalty.

## Enhance marketing
Through pulling data from your sales and analytics, you can also learn more about your future customers and how to reach them. Business intelligence can help you by comparing the data with your promotion channels, such as Facebook, to gain knowledge of how to successfully advertise your products to a specific group of customers.

## Make data-driven decisions
Emotional or intuitive decisions pose risks you cannot afford. To keep the competition at bay, you have to make more data-driven decisions. With the information gathered by your BI tool, you can be prepared for the fluctuation of demand. Having the whole database at your fingertips will make it easier to make better decisions and justify your actions and decisions.

There is a reason why business intelligence is one of the hottest technology trends of the decade. It can answer the most crucial questions and help you better understand your company and customers.

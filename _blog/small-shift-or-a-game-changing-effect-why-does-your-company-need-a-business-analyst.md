Many companies today still do not cater for the role of a business analyst, instead they assume that this work can be taken on by a project manager or web developer. It is as a result of this that many projects fail, as there lacks any proper communication between a client and the developers. It is thus essential for businesses to carve out space for a business analyst within their team and hire someone who will be experienced in transforming the relationship between client and developer.

## The role of a business analyst
Put simply, a business analyst intercedes between a potential client and the company which provides the product or service. A business analyst is tasked with understanding exactly what the client needs, even if they have to read between the lines of what they say they want, after which they pass this information to the development team. A business analyst is also responsible for providing a proper channel of communication, informing both sides about any potential changes.

## Are they really an ‘analyst’?
The position is defined as an ‘analyst’ role due to a large portion of the work being dedicated to analysing what a client wants and then determining what it is they need. Furthermore, a business analyst will often be tasked with understanding the team vision, making sure the views of both the client and development team are aligned, and putting together a solution if not. A business analyst is often looked at as a medium between the client and the development team, who understands the language of both parties and is able to provide a uniform solution that satisfies everyone involved.

## The ideal candidate
What does it take to make a good business analyst then and what should you pay attention to while looking to hire one? The right person is able to easily develop agile skills, which in turn enables them to communicate with others better. Interceding between a client and the team also requires being well-versed in the technical issues at hand so that they can translate them to a non-technical client.

## Required skills
The most important and appreciated skill within business analysis, is the ability to provide a proper channel of communication through the entire process of creating a product. There are BAs who also choose to further educate themselves around domain knowledge in order to improve the mechanism of translating the information. Knowing the product in its entirety allows the business analyst to explain it better. However, when searching for a BA, you should remember that this feature is not a necessary one and focus primarily on the agile skills. An understanding of the IT sector is simply a beneficial addition.

Hopefully now you better understand the importance of incorporating a business analyst into your team. Finding someone who is always curious and often asks “why?” can help your business succeed, improving the way your team works at the same time. Ready to publish that job offer?

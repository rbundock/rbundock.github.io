There is no doubt that children are our future. We do our best to bring them up to be responsible and organized people. We also try to pay them as much attention as possible. Unfortunately, sometimes it is not so simple. There are many other time-consuming responsibilities that we cannot avoid or leave for later. We need to go to work and earn money for basic needs like food, clothes, and medicines or pick up Grandma from the airport.

What is important to remember is that children look at the world from a completely different perspective than adults do. They do not know much about life, so sometimes when an unexpected accident occurs, they feel really frightened or disoriented. As a parent you have to be with them to help them. But if no one can predict the future, then who will help you to be there for your children every time they need you? – Until now it was impossible to retrieve such information so quickly. Nowadays, there are applications that help to correctly identify health troubles or offer an extended guide on how to take care of babies.
 
## Solutions available
New technologies, globalization and global technological progress are creating new opportunities for creative people every day. In modern society, almost everyone is using a smartphone, almost everyone has access to the Internet, and almost everyone is connected. On the market we can find applications to help child care, such as:
 
**Kid Care** – an application connected with a diseases database, that helps parents to identify what is happening and what disease the child has.
 
**Amazing Baby** – a mobile application that contains examples of exercises for babies to stimulate their development.

Technology is the future. Developing solutions for children and parents that help them in casual situations and improve their everyday life is smart. Because when the basics are better, everything is.
 

## Why does it matter?
 
**For Kids**

With all of these technologies and inventions, kids receive help at all stages of their life. They can feel safe at night when sleeping or get proper help with the right exercises. Using a homework platform is a great idea that gives the child an additional motivation to reach goals and better organise problem solving. It makes children feel less frustrated, gives them more free-time, more fun with friends, better grades in school, and more overall knowledge.
 
**For Parents**

In the meantime, parents can save a great deal of time and troubles. For example, when you have your electronic nanny turned on, you do not have to wake up every 30 minutes to check what is happening – that is a true sense of comfort. Also, information about exercises for babies can be very, very satisfying – especially when your little girl makes her first steps. These ideas bring a large number of benefits: peace of mind, comfort, safety, time-saving, etc. The list goes on, however, what really matters is that nowadays applications are getting better and more useful.

New inventions have a considerable potential – they can significantly improve the functioning of the household. It is obvious that at the beginning they require some work and time to get used to them. But as soon as they become a daily habit, they start to be an indispensable tool for planning, managing and monitoring important life events. Also they can be expanded, as new features are gradually implemented into the application. What is your opinion? Maybe you have other interesting ideas on how to help kids or parents?

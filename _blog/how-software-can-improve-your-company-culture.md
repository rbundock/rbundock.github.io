## Do not trust stereotypes
Many different articles are trying to answer questions about improving the company culture or trying to measure it with various indicators. It is difficult because company culture combines employee behaviour, values, norms, systems, symbols, language, assumptions, beliefs and habits. It is even more difficult since many indicators can be easily affected by each other. All these actions may change specific organisations' culture, but in huge enterprises, some of these indicators are regulated by internal rules. It is crucial for you and your employees to feel comfortable, and that is why company culture is so influential. It should meet employees' expectations about the atmosphere in the workplace and, at the same time, make the work efficient. Searching for this perfect balance is not easy; it takes time and multiple attempts but it is about striving for perfection.

The software itself is one of the components of an organisation, and, like others, it also influences company culture. Have that in mind when deciding on acquiring a new software solution. It can not only improve your company's performance but also affect your company's culture.

## Make work easier
You want your employees to create a bond and be friends with one another because they work more efficiently and enjoy their work in a good atmosphere. It is also crucial to build relationships and unite with positive emotions, not through the common enemy, such as an unpleasant team manager or a non-user-friendly software solution. Misfit software can be very frustrating and waste a lot of time, and frustrated employees will not want to spend more time at work. On the other hand, if the software solution is user-friendly and tailored for your business to perform all the necessary tasks, your employees will not have to expend their energy on being angry. Instead, they will get to know each other and find work to be a more comfortable place.

## Increase collaboration
Your software should not be a common enemy but an ally to all your employees. Efficient software solutions can influence employees' work and make them collaborate to produce the best outcome. When the software solution works correctly, employees can focus on work, not dealing with software problems and looking for help to solve them. Proper software solutions should also be designed to engage people to work together and make communication easy and clear. A great example is Cloud ERP Software, which puts all the internal company functions onto one platform that can be accessible and transparent for everyone in the company. That makes work more comfortable and significantly more efficient because it allows people from different departments and offices to collaborate and access information more easily.

## Reduce mistakes
Software errors are one of the most hated things at work. Whenever an error occurs, it means more work or even missing deadlines and overworking. None of these situations will make the company culture better or stronger. There are many ways that software can help with that. A software solution can update all the databases on the spot, which reduces the risk of making a mistake and saves a lot of time and energy. The most critical scenario for most companies is losing important files and data. This can be a potential disaster for the whole company and its culture. Software is one of the best ways to avoid the possibility of such errors occurring. Modern software often creates backup files in the cloud or a spare company's storage. That way, backup data always exists somewhere, and you can recover it even if the original file is gone forever. You can be sure this can help reduce stress amongst your employees.

## Save money
Software often helps to save money by optimising and automating certain processes. It increases the efficiency and precision of work, which significantly influences the outcome and revenues. You can read more about saving money through well-tailored software in this article. No matter how you manage to save money, it can go back to your employees. It always makes the atmosphere at work better. Knowing a reward awaits them, your employees will come to the office more enthusiastically.

It is all about striving for perfection when it comes to company culture, and the more you work on it, the closer to perfection it will be. It would be best if you always were very careful when making significant changes that would impact the company culture and act consciously to make only positive ones, such as installing an efficient software solution. Another conscious choice should be choosing the right software company to provide you with a software solution. You can find information on how to find the right one in this article.

## Are you looking for new construction software?
Many challenges lie ahead for the industry post-lockdown. Right from workforce availability, supply of raw materials, monitoring workers' health at the site are a few issues to name.

Many companies within the construction industry are starting to take a greater look at the software and tools they have in place and are realising it may be time for an upgrade. It is increasingly important for these companies to have fully functioning software that helps to align all tasks, projects and data in one place.
Slow, outdated systems particularly impact construction projects, as they must reach their goals at a given schedule, budget and quality.

## Why construction projects benefit from updated software
If you manage a construction project, you are tasked with ensuring everything goes to plan. The tasks involved with construction management need relevant expertise, the right tools and experience. As a construction project manager, you must build a strong working relationship with the multiple agents involved in your project.

This is partly why having the right project management tool can make a significant difference to the project's delivery and outcome, helping you streamline your work. However, finding the right project management tool can often be overwhelming; with so many choices, it can be challenging to understand what best suits your needs. Furthermore, out-of-the-box solutions can usually not cover all of your needs OR can include an extensive list of additional and unnecessary functions, which would leave you with a hefty bill at the end. With that said, there are a few things that you need to consider before you start your search for construction project management software.

## A helpful software checklist
### Here is a construction software checklist with questions that can help you reach the best decision:

- Will the system help streamline work?
- Will the platform assist with real-time project management?
- Will the software improve both tracking and accountability?
- Is the software able to provide you with accurate results?
- Can the software be integrated with other products?
- Does the software help modernise your project or business?
- What is the overall cost of running the software?
- Does the provider offer technical support for the system?
- Does the provider offer training for the software?
- Is the software intended to be used on multiple computers?
- Can the system be accessed via mobile?
- Will a transition to a new system compromise your data security?
- Do you need a web-based or on-site solution?


## The most essential features construction software should have
Once you have answered those questions, here are a few features you should also look for when picking a system.

***Real-time Updates***: As well as needing to be able to keep track of what's going on around your project instantaneously, stakeholders should also be able to estimate the construction project completion time. The system should allow you to monitor your project's progress at any moment.

***Easy to use reporting tools***: The system should have a simple reporting tool to empower communication between all sides. This will increase productivity within the project and simplify task management.

***Unlimited accessibility***: While working on a construction project, unhindered access to the project is critical. It is, therefore, essential that the system can be accessed through a mobile platform. You must be able to use your mobile on-site and report on project updates.

***Secure Cloud Hosting***: The system should be able to store all your information securely. Top-level security for all your data is crucial.

***Issue Tracking***: You should be able to track issues easily within the system by documenting them so that stakeholders can follow up.

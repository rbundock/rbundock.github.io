## Touchless check-in/check-out from the construction site
As construction companies bring their employees together again and reopen construction sites, numerous calculations need to be made to provide an environment that will keep workers safe, healthy and productive. One area in particular that will need to be updated is the system employees use to check themselves in and out. Instead, a touchless system can be implemented to comply with health and safety, limit the spread of the virus and still retain employee information and data.

## How does a touchless check-in system work?
A new touchless system would help streamline the job site check-in process for construction workers and those visiting the construction site. Employees and visitors would be required to point their smartphones at a unique QR code posted at the job site and then answer COVID-19 health-related questions needed by local health directives. What is essential is that no download is required. After this, the employee or visitor will be denied or approved access to the construction site and receive a daily digital entry badge.

All of the data and information are collected and stored securely, ensuring data privacy for those entering the site. At the same time, site supervisors can see the health status of all onsite employees and visitors and immediately be notified of potential health issues.

## The benefits of updating your check-in system
By implementing a new system, you will not only be ensuring the health and safety of all those entering your construction site, but you will also be able to access real-time data whenever needed. A touchless visitor management system can help you to optimise time management and automate some of your time-keeping processes.

For those working in construction a major concern in the current climate is the lack of systems that are compliant with new health and safety regulations. A modern visitor management solution which allows for touchless check-in and -out can help your workplace thrive. It will also streamline your business processes, resulting in financial savings that follow improved business workflows.

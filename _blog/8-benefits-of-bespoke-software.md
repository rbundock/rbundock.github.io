Over the years, software solutions have become necessary when running a business efficiently and thus making it succeed. They owe their popularity to the outstanding possibilities operating systems can offer to a company, no matter the size or industry. Suppose you have been considering acquiring software for your business. In that case, you have two options: an off-the-shelf package produced for the mass market or a bespoke solution developed especially for your company to meet all of its needs.

## Off-the-shelf software
There is no doubt that commercial products are cheaper and less time-consuming when compared to custom software solutions. There are a lot of ready-made packages you can start using right away. However, they are designed to answer the demands of as many companies as possible. The number of features can often slow down your business instead of improving productivity. Also, finding all the functionalities you need in a single package is sometimes challenging.

## Bespoke software
Contrary to commercial products, tailor-made software is a solution offering your company all the necessary features that are relevant to your team. It can take time and money to develop an individually crafted program, but it should be regarded as investing in the future of your business. If you wonder how to benefit from a bespoke solution, keep reading.

## Benefits of bespoke software
Bespoke software solutions are often dedicated to unique organisations that cannot find a commercial package that meets their requirements. On the contrary, tailor-made software can be beneficial for every company because of the following:

### 1. Control

When buying custom software, you are the one who decides what the solution will look like and how it will work in general. Business analysts gather all of your requirements and then translate them for the development team, ensuring you receive precisely what you need.      

The agile methodology is a unique approach many bespoke software companies practise. Thanks to direct contact with the developers, you can provide them with your feedback during the development process based on how you find certain functionalities. There is no need to worry if your requirements change, as the developers will adjust them.

Another thing you are in charge of is updates. In the case of off-the-shelf products, there is often a demand to upgrade your software. The latest versions contain various features your business may not need, which can cause you many problems when they are not compatible with your data. When it comes to a bespoke solution, you decide when and how to upgrade your software.

### 2. Simplicity

Commercial products tend to be loaded with functionalities, which very often slows down the speed of the entire system and makes it more challenging to use simultaneously. Bespoke solutions, on the other hand, offer all the features you need and nothing more, which improves a company's workflow.

When going bespoke, you can also be sure your team will understand the software well. It doesn't contain unnecessary and inappropriate components, which shortens the learning time. By working with the developers right from the beginning, you can avoid employees having problems with the software or working manually.

Another issue which makes bespoke software simple is the integration. If your company has used multiple off-the-shelf solutions in the past, the developers can easily integrate them into one package without losing valuable data.

### 3. Efficiency

Using proper software has a significant impact on the efficiency of your work. By introducing communication tools, for example, an instant messaging tool, you can improve collaborative working in your company. It brings your employees closer, boosting their productivity in general.

Bespoke software is also a valuable device when it comes to setting goals. Ordering the solution itself forces you to learn what your business needs and its direction. It also offers excellent analytical tools, allowing you to visualise your work's effects. That way, you can discover your company's flaws and eliminate them.

Custom solutions not only offer efficiency, but they are also developed efficiently. Thanks to the agile approach, a software development company can provide flexibility when it comes to changing your requirements during the development process or upgrading the product after it goes live.

### 4. Scalability

Bespoke software can be crucial as your business evolves. Off-the-shelf solutions usually limit your choice to either buying cheap software that cannot fit the business size or choosing a program that can support your company on a large scale but is too expensive for your organisation simultaneously. When it comes to bespoke software, the solution is much more scalable.

You are the intellectual property owner, which means you do not need to seek permission to make changes to your software. You can have it upgraded and extended to a few more features your business may need while evolving. In the case of commercial products, there would be a need to buy another package.

Scalability also allows you to extend the number of software users without slowing the solution down. Bespoke software will work just as quickly when used by one hundred and one thousand people. There is no need to pay more for licence fees.

### 5. Branding

Details are the key to success. You can easily beat your competitors with a few extra features developed uniquely for your business. Personalised tools such as auto-generated messages show the users that you put much effort into your work. Building a professional brand identity may help you win new customers.

### 6. Security

Going bespoke can prevent your business from becoming the next hacking victim. Small companies that use ready-made software solutions are often great targets for hackers. Commonly used commercial packages are constantly endangered as encrypting one system allows hackers to gain access to the details of many companies. When it comes to bespoke software, it protects your business from external threats. Breaching a tailor-made system is much more complex and gives hackers much less data in return.

### 7. Ownership

Owning the software as intellectual property is another factor that protects your business. You are not obliged to continue cooperation with any specific vendor as you are the legal owner of the product. If you are unsatisfied with the service, you can easily find another software company to take care of your solution.

The ownership also allows you to save money. In the case of off-the-shelf packages, there is a licence fee you have to pay for each user, which is not necessary when it comes to bespoke solutions. You decide how many employees can access the software.

### 8. Maintenance

Maintenance is, without doubt, the most significant advantage of bespoke software solutions. In the case of off-the-shelf packages, your company is one out of thousands who use the software, and only one development team can fix a bug. Regarding bespoke solutions, a custom software development company guarantees to monitor the software and fix any bug you report after your product is ready to go live. That way, you can be confident that your software will work flawlessly.

A bespoke software development company is legally obliged to support your software for as long as you require, which gives you additional protection. When the producer of your commercial solution goes bankrupt or decides to maintain the product no longer, you will have to pay unexpected costs.

Your company does not need to have uncommon requirements to enjoy cyber threat protection, unique branding, increased workplace efficiency and other benefits of bespoke software solutions. Using tailor-made software is valuable for your company, and your customers will also appreciate it.

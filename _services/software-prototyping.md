title: "Software prototyping"
description: 
summary: Prototyping is used to test various aspects of a solution. It allows you to identify unexpected user behaviour, and spot problems or gaps in a concept. At this stage, the goal is to create an experience and provoke a response. Creating prototypes is at the heart of turning an idea into a product. We ensure that all of our software is built with well-reviewed code, result-driven agile processes and well-designed practices, to deliver IT solutions that can grow with your business.

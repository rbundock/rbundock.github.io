# Your one-stop software development outsourcing partner
Why outsource software development? Perhaps you’ve identified a need for a new system, application or software. An off-the-shelf solution doesn’t give you what you need, and building it in-house is resource-hungry and requires skills you don’t have. Outsourcing your software development can be a time- and cost-effective solution.

## How do our software development outsourcing services work?
Whatever software you’re looking for – a new app, reporting tool, mobile game – we can develop it on your behalf. Our managed teams can take the lead and run with the whole project, or work in collaboration with you as an extension of your team. Whether you want to outsource all or just part of the development, we’ve got you covered.

Here are just some of the ways we can get involved:

New build
For a greenfield solution, we would start with one or two lead developers to get things started, scope out requirements and put the right processes in place. Followed by a period of ramping up with the optimum team in place. From solution design and engineering to development and activation, we’re focused on delivery.
Build in progress
Sometimes you just need more people on the job. We can supplement your in-house team with our experienced developers, who will work alongside yours to bring your solution to delivery. We’ll work rapidly to understand your processes and operate as a seamless extension of your team.
Build in need of help
For a build that’s run into trouble, an objective perspective can be invaluable. Whatever the reason your software development has foundered, we can pick up the reins, identify any issues and work with you to strengthen processes and practices.

Existing solution
The work isn’t over once the software’s built. While you might have been able to spare your in-house team for the duration of the development, now you need them to work on something else. We can build a new team to take over, freeing up your resource.

Whatever your need, we’re experts at building teams who are ruthlessly focused on the end goal – delivering working software.

What are the benefits of outsourcing your software development projects
This very flexible way of resourcing your development leaves your headcount and staffing budget unchanged. Here are four other reasons to consider outsourcing your software development.
1. Cost effectiveness
With no need to hire, onboard or train staff, outsourcing your software development is much more cost effective than building your own team.
2. Efficiency
Our extensive experience and proven processes mean we can get started quickly and progress at pace.
3. Quality
Outsourcing your software development means you benefit from best practice methodologies and the latest development skill sets. We apply the utmost rigour to every engagement.
4. Peace of mind
No dealing with a recruiter, no HR responsibilities, no ongoing management. We oversee all aspects of our teams’ productivity and output so you don’r have to.

What is the cost of outsourcing software development?
The cost of your outsourced software development takes into account a number of different factors, including:

The scale of the project – how complex is it, and how long is it likely to take?
The level of expertise required – what development and project management skills are needed?
The number of people needed – how many people will be in the team at each stage?
As the team is built to your exact specifications, the cost will also be bespoke to you. At HeadChannel we always flex the team to the requirements of the project or engagement – so you’re only ever paying for what you need. And it’s certainly more cost effective than recruiting and training your own in-house team.

We’re committed to total transparency, and use the SFIA rate card structure to standardise our capabilities, responsibilities and costs. That means we’re competitively priced, with no hidden surprises.

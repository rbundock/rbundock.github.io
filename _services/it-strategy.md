# Effective IT strategies to take your business forward
A robust IT strategy is crucial to business growth. As digital technology plays a central role in so many organisations – both operationally and commercially – making sure it’s optimised to deliver value is just good sense. That’s where IT strategy comes in.

## What is an IT strategy and why is it important?
At its heart, an IT strategy is simply a plan. A plan for your IT that’s aligned to your organisation’s strategic and operational goals.

However your business is looking to achieve growth – by improving efficiencies, reducing spend, or innovating in product and service delivery – an IT strategy will spell out how technology can help you get there. Where you decide to focus your budget will depend on the best way to gain competitive advantage.

Of course, a strategy is only as good as its execution and delivery. So a good digital and IT strategy should be clear about the practical short- and medium-term actions needed to deliver on your long-term strategic goals.

It’s not simply about doing more things, or different things – sometimes it’s about doing the same things better. And without a plan, a business can end up pulling in different directions, investing in software, platforms and devices that fail to deliver on their promises. Or missing out on game-changing opportunities.

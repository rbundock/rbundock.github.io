faqs:
  - 
    - "What should an IT strategy include?"
    - "There is no one-size-fits all, but we believe a good IT strategy should include the following:
    * A set of principles: the things you won’t compromise on. For example, all future technology solutions will be based on open-source software.
    * A set of goals: the things that you want to achieve. Nice to haves but not project deal breakers.
    * A prioritised list of initiatives: IT projects and actions mapped to the McFarlan Matrix to identify offensive versus defensive measures. And quick turnaround versus strategic ones.
    * A threat assessment: an objective review of the prioritised list through the lens of macro factors that may affect it. For example, competitor activity or legislative changes
    * A long-term outlook on technology: how will technology help you capitalise on opportunities and/or mitigate threats to deliver your prioritised list of initiatives?
    * A budget: the final piece of the puzzle – the cost of delivering the strategy.
    Importantly, an IT strategy should be a living document. Market landscapes change, technologies evolve, and business objectives will change with them. Regular review and updates should be embedded in your strategy."

    - "How do you develop an IT strategy?"
    - "1. Understand and confirm your business’s operational and strategic goals
    2. Engage with stakeholders across the business to understand specific IT requirements/pain points
    3. Devise a plan for ways in which technology can support the business in achieving its goals. At this stage it will be a long list of potential initiatives
    4. Map your long list against the McFarlan Matrix to understand offensive versus defensive measures, and tactical versus strategic
    5. Conduct a peer review of your long list to identify the measures that will deliver genuine commercial value and define a prioritised list of activity6. Conduct a threat assessment by considering macro factors that may affect your strategy
    7. Identify any opportunities presented by new or emerging technologies
    8. Document your approach and embed regular review points into your internal processes"
  - 
    - "What is the role of IT strategy in business?"
    - "An IT strategy works alongside your overall business strategy to define how technology will help you achieve your organisational goals. In some cases, it can even help define those goals in the first place.
    
    A good IT strategy ensures you’re using IT to best effect in your business. It helps you gain competitive advantage by improving or innovating in product and service delivery. And it means all stakeholders are aligned with and understand the role IT should play in the business."

# Effective IT strategies to take your business forward
A robust IT strategy is crucial to business growth. As digital technology plays a central role in so many organisations – both operationally and commercially – making sure it’s optimised to deliver value is just good sense. That’s where IT strategy comes in.

## What is an IT strategy and why is it important?
At its heart, an IT strategy is simply a plan. A plan for your IT that’s aligned to your organisation’s strategic and operational goals.

However your business is looking to achieve growth – by improving efficiencies, reducing spend, or innovating in product and service delivery – an IT strategy will spell out how technology can help you get there. Where you decide to focus your budget will depend on the best way to gain competitive advantage.

Of course, a strategy is only as good as its execution and delivery. So a good digital and IT strategy should be clear about the practical short- and medium-term actions needed to deliver on your long-term strategic goals.

It’s not simply about doing more things, or different things – sometimes it’s about doing the same things better. And without a plan, a business can end up pulling in different directions, investing in software, platforms and devices that fail to deliver on their promises. Or missing out on game-changing opportunities.

# Ecommerce apps that boost the buying experience
The growth of online shopping – in particular via mobile – shows no sign of slowing down.

So it’s no surprise that retailers are increasingly looking to ecommerce (or mcommerce) apps to customise the online buying experience, and increase conversion.

# Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy
## Our Commitment
We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains. We are committed to implementing systems and controls aimed at ensuring that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere within our organization or in any of our supply chains.

## Our Expectations of Suppliers and Business Partners
We expect all suppliers, contractors, business partners and any other parties associated with our organization to uphold the same high ethical standards as we do. This includes prohibiting the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labor, or anyone held in slavery or servitude. We expect our suppliers to hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.

## Responsibility
Management at all levels have responsibility for ensuring those reporting to them understand and comply with this policy. Employees are required to avoid any activities that could lead to a breach of this policy. Employees must immediately report any actual or suspected breaches of this policy.

## Communication and Awareness
Training on this policy forms part of the induction process for all individuals who work for us. Updates will be provided as needed. Our zero-tolerance approach will be communicated to all suppliers and business partners.

## Compliance
Any employee found in violation of this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for misconduct. We may terminate relationships with suppliers, contractors or partners if they breach this policy.

## Reporting Concerns
We aim to encourage openness and support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suffers detrimental treatment or unfavorable actions as a result of reporting concerns. Detrimental treatment will be treated as a disciplinary offense.

## Policy Review
We will review this policy regularly as part of our risk management and corporate governance procedures.
